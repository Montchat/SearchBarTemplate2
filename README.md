####SearchBarTemplate2

SearchBarTemplate2 is a Template that serves as a starting point for people to add Search Bars into their apps.

It incoporates a lot of common functionality seen with most SearchBars including the ability to touch to dimiss. It will filter data and it will do it with a delay so that queries are not sent prematurely to a server.
